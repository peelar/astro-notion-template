  <h1>Poltergeist</h1>
</div>

Poltergeist is [Astro](https://astro.build/) + [Notion](https://notion.so) based content platform.

The 🐒 idea is: you write your posts in Notion, Astro consumes and renders them as pages.

The 🦍 idea is: you choose where you manage your content (Notion/Obsidian/VSCode/whatever), Poltergeist provides the infrastructure and integrations, and Astro renders your content.

See [todo](todo.md) for the current status.
